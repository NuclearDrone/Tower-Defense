# Tower Defense

A simple tower defense game using Scala. Your goal is to eliminate enemies moving along the path. The game is endless and the enemies become stronger every few waves. The game is scored on how far you reached and lost when you lose your total health points, reduced whenever an enemy reaches the exit.

The game is somewhat configurable. It has an save and load function to a file. The game UI is handled using ScalaFX 2D graphics. 


## How to run

As this was my first Scala project, I didn't configure the project to be built and ran outside of the development environment.

It can be however ran with Eclipse by importing the project and running the UIApp.scala.
